The code for GARFY, a discord bot developed by DWAA1660, and Blackhole927.

Cogs is the folder that contains most the code for the bot.
Saving is where data is saved, such as discord ranks.
There is also a folder called resources, that was unable to be uploaded. It contained image files for the commands in Cogs/image.py
